Netflix is worth about $83 billion. But it did not become that way by just showing you movies from your home. Netflix built an advanced recommendation system using big data and machine learning in order to predict what you would want to watch next. This would direct your attention to staying on their interface longer and provide you a "better" watching experience. Netflix's rec system is cool, but building your own is cool too!

Using the clustering method, I divide a list of movie watchers into k clusters and find them movie recommendations. I cross reference movies they have already watched with similar movies watched and rated by others.
