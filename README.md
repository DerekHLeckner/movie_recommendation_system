Netflix is worth about $83 billion. But it did not become that way by just showing you movies from your home. Netflix built an advanced recommendation system using big data and machine learning in order to predict what you would want to watch next. This would direct your attention to staying on their interface longer and provide you a "better" watching experience. Netflix's rec system is cool, but building your own is cool too!

Using the clustering method, I divide a list of movie watchers into k clusters and find them movie recommendations. I cross reference movies they have already watched with similar movies watched and rated by others.

I want to add a feature where a user inputs all the movies they have seen, and give them reccomendations. However, given there's a lot of movies, this would take forever. So I made sure you can see what movies a random chosen user has seen when you run the system, that way you can view the reccomendations and judge accuracy for yourself!

Please execute the main.py file, not the notebook. If you want to use the notebook, you can use it to play around with the clusters and see how it may make a difference with the reccomendations. There are other approaches as well to this system. Another approach is the jaccard similarity. However I will be pushing a repository with that application in another project!

Please check out this Medium link where I discuss more about the project!
